CXGN::Cview::MapFactory - a factory object for CXGN::Cview::Map objects
           
=head1 SYNOPSYS

 my $map_factory  = CXGN::Cview::MapFactory->new($dbh);
 $map = $map_factory->create({map_version_id=>"u1"});
         
=head1 DESCRIPTION

The MapFactory object is part of a compatibility layer that defines the data sources of the comparative mapviewer. If there are different types of maps that can be distinguished by their ids, the MapFactory should be implemented to return the right map object for the given id. Of course, the corresponding map object also needs to be implemented, using the interface defined in CXGN::Cview::Map .

The MapFactory constructor takes a database handle (preferably constructed using CXGN::DB::Connection object). The map objects can then be constructed using the create function, which takes a hashref as a parameter, containing either map_id or map_version_id as a key (but not both). map_ids will be converted to map_version_ids immediately. Map_version_ids are then analyzed and depending on its format, CXGN::Cview::Map object of the proper type is returned. 

The function get_all_maps returns all maps as list of appropriate CXGN::Cview::Map::* objects.

For the current SGN implementation, the following identifier formats are defined and yield following corresponding map objects

 \d+       refers to a map id in the database and yields either a
           CXGN::Cview::Map::SGN::Genetic (type genetic)
           CXGN::Cview::Map::SGN::FISH (type fish)
           CXGN::Cview::Map::SGN::Sequence (type sequence)
 u\d+      refers to a user defined map and returns:
           CXGN::Cview::Map::SGN::User object
 filepath  refers to a map defined in a file and returns a
           CXGN::Cview::Map::SGN::File object
 il\d+      refers to a population id in the phenome.population table
           (which must be of type IL) and returns a
           CXGN::Cview::Map::SGN::IL object
 p\d+      CXGN::Cview::Map::SGN::Physical
 c\d+      CXGN::Cview::Map::SGN::Contig
 o         CXGN::Cview::Map::SGN::ProjectStats map object
 
The actual map objects returned are defined in the CXGN::Cview::Maps namespace. Because this is really a compatibility layer, an additional namespace of the resource is appended, such that a genetic map at SGN could be defined as CXGN::Cview::Maps::SGN::Genetic . If no corresponding map is found, undef is returned.
